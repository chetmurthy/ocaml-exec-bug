camlp5-buildscripts Version 0.03
-------------------

* [22 Jul 2023] Stupid, stupid, stupid error in ya-wrap-ocamlfind (was ignoring return-code from invoked command)

  This caused errors in builds in pa_ppx* packages to be silently ignored.  Ugh.  What idiocy.  Fixed.
  This means that older pa_ppx* packages cannot build with this package/version.  But it's only b/c they
  enable "debugging preprocessing" by default. If that's disabled, then they build fine.  But still, what
  a mess.

  That this is such a tiny error is even more maddening.

camlp5-buildscripts Version 0.02
-------------------

* [30 Jan 2023] some small changes
  ya-wrap-ocamlfind: change syntax of header comment to "(**pp ... *)"
  join_meta: reverse order of subdirs for wrap-subdirs, so more comprehensible to invokers

  all: change bootstrap to not generate static blocks, switch to pa_ppx_regexp

camlp5-buildscripts Version 0.01
-------------------

* [30 Jan 2023] First release
